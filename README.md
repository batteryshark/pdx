# Paradox Libraries

This is a collection of loadable modules for isolating a process and/or emulating another operating environment.

It provides services such as environment emulation/spoofing, filesystem redirection, registry redirection, process legacy management, and more.

Currently, these libraries support both Windows and Linux (x86 / x64) with Mac support as an eventual step.

For additional details about each library, please refer to its respective documentation.

For Debug Logging, set the environment variable "PDXDBG" before running a process.
